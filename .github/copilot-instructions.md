# Copilot Instructions
Write automated tests in Playwright following these guidelines:

- Follow Playwright best practices
- Do not add comments to each fine of code
- Write only the Playwright test steps for the scenario
- Read and analyze the provided DOM context from the browser
- Create one test at a time unless specifically asked for multiple tests
- Prioritize `getByRole()`getByText()' selectors over 'locator()' when possible
- Keep test code clean and focused .on the test scenario
- Don't add assertions unless asked
- For the .random .test data, keep it short and .compact. Don't write .long.texts.
